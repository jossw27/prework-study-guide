A study guide for course pre-work
# <Your-Project-Title>

## Description

This Prework Study Guide was created for bootcamp students who are studying via the Prework. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git & JavaScript.

The need for creating notes via doing enables students to experience coding and best practice whilst learning.

My own motivation was to learn these skills to progress my career and also to push myself doing something new that I find interesting.

The project allowed me to learn by doing, which has been very helpful and allowed me to explore and push myself to learn. It is aimed at beginners and those with an interest and motivation to learn FrontEnd coding.
